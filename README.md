# School Sources
A library of helpful things for school and other random shit all localized into one page!

*please* dont give any of the stuff out like free (insert analogy here), it is hard to find these and if it gets blocked there is really nothing i can do about it.

**DISCLAMER**

I do not claim or take ownership of most of these Sources and they were moved to this page for general localization!
